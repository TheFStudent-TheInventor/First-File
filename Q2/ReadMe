Signed Text 

-Note that I modified the code so that it would work within one file to make my life easier. If you were taking the real test, the code would be written
slightly differently but the methods function the same way. 

-For this question, reading the test cases is actually even more important because the code excludes many features you may want in a real program.
For example, if I were a user, I would've liked my initials capitalized but that's not a part of the test. 

-Honestly not much to say for getSignature.

-The main issue I faced during this question was overcomplicating the code. I spent unnessasary time for addSignature because I wanted to remove the signature 
if it was in the middle of the text (For example if text= SigmaR-izzler and the signature was just R-izz, I wanted to make it become Sigmaler). However, I ended up spending 
an extra 15 minutes doing that and likely messing up on the test too. A test case where the signature was in the middle was NEVER EXPLICITLY mentioned in the test cases so 
we didn't have to worry about them.

-Main take away is to do what your told on the test. At the end of the day, you're not learning coding but you're learning the fundamentals of code.
