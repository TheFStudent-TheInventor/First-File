Matches and Competitors

-Likely the hardest out of all of them for most

Part A
-Nothing to say here, it's pretty easy 
-Just remember that their rank should be one more than their index within the list.
-Also you don't need to create the arraylist since they already made it as an instance variable. 

Part B
-Much more challenging because of the 2 different cases, if the number of competitors is even or odd.
-If it's even, the numbers are quite simple, we just run the code by half the number of competitors and the rest of the numbers are easy.
-However, if it's odd, we need to run the code the same number of times. Also the index of the second competitor is also confusing.
Your first index is 1, so the index for the second competitor should simply be length - i. 
-Following the test, I asked many people about their answers and got many different answers.

-Once again, we over thought the question. We didn't need to make it 2 cases, I saw a solution which solved it without any if statements. 
-The biggest issue was numbers but still the question wasn't too bad.
