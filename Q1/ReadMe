Dog Walker

-This one took by far the longest amount of time for me to read(Around 20 minutes of just reading) just to even 
understand part A. 
-In reality it was much more simple than it seemed. All we needed to do was find how many dogs the walker can walk and update it to the company.
This quesion would take both helper methods which makes it far more simple. The only part that might require thinking are the 2 cases that may occur,
if the walker's maximum is higher than the number of dogs available or not.
-My main struggle with both is just reading
