Dog Walker

Part A
-This one took by far the longest amount of time for me to read(Around 20 minutes of just reading) just to even 
understand part A. 
-In reality it was much more simple than it seemed. All we needed to do was find how many dogs the walker can walk and update it to the company.
This quesion would take both helper methods which makes it far more simple. The only part that might require thinking are the 2 cases that may occur,
if the walker's maximum is higher than the number of dogs available or not.

Part B
-Part B is actually very simple. All it requires is a loop, a if statement within the loop to check for every hour, and a total variable. 
-Ofc use the method created in part A. Generally questions with helper methods are easier but always think about how they could be used if helper methods are included 
in the question.
-Not much difficulty with this question, even during the exam. 

-Overall, the main struggle was just reading.
