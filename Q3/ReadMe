Matches and Competitors

-Likely the hardest out of all of them for most

Part A
-Nothing to say here, it's pretty easy 
-Just remember that their rank should be one more than their index within the list.
-Also you don't need to create the arraylist since they already made it as an instance variable. 

Part B
-Much more challenging because of the 2 different cases, if the number of competitors is even or odd.
